# Client-Portfolio
This is the client portfolio for the week 2 homework assignment of the UW Coding Bootcamp. In this README is a brief description of what the task entails. The task was set out for us to learn how to make our own page from scratch while giving us a guideline of what the page should look like but NOT any code. Moving forward it was very important that the page follows HTML semantics as well as making the code easy to follow for future use.

## User Story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## My Journey

    Bringing this site to life following only the photo that was given was not easy for a beginner like myself, but after a few hours all the CSS and HTML jargon started to really click with me. I started off by making all the HTML components so I could just work on purely the appearance from then on out. For the most part this stayed true although there were little changes I made throughout my time working on this page. The biggest enlightenment was realizing it would be easier to work on the section dividing them into columns rather than thinking of each section as their own row. Switching the classes up here really changed the game for me.

    The biggest issue I faced was the Work section and getting flexboxes to cooperate how they are intended to. In the end I realized that I was having trouble with when parents or their children need to have the CSS properties or vice versa. Once I got past this hurdle creating the page felt like a breeze.

    Overall I am very happy with the outcome of this page and its responsiveness. Learning how to make a page mobile friendly was really and great tool to add to my arsenal.

## The Page Details and Comments
    
    The work section banners are a bit tricky. I used CSS properties of background-image and linear gradient to recreate the tint of the template, but I had to create seperate background-images (using the same photo) with the hover selector attached to the corresponding classes and remove the gradient so when the cursor was hovering over the banners the tint disappeared.

    NOTE: There is no resume nor projects linked to their corresponding links as I don't have these ready yet although when I get them ready this page will be updated.

## Resources

    I tried to make everything as cohesive yet my own as possible. That being said its impossible not to look for answers when hitting a brick wall this early in the game. I did That being said these are the resources that I often referred to when searching for help. While there was a plethora of pages I looked at there wasn't one definitive page of a site I kept coming back to.
